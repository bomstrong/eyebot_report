\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

In the previous sections we explored the different blocks and technologies used in this project. We looked at how to capture and process images to detect a line, and how to calculate an error signal from the segmented image. By using a camera, we archived a much more precise and accurate error signal, compared to a regular array of photo sensors. By that we archived a more smoother line following, with performance comparable to real world usage in autonomous vehicles.
